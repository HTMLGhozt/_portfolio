title: A Slow Burn
---

<p>
	I've wanted a blog for a while, as I think writing improves my mental
	organization<sup>[<a id="julian-write-ref" href="#julian-write">1</a>]</sup>.
	I also read more while researching, while researching web practises for
	creating this blog, I came across
	<a
		href="https://css-tricks.com/10-mouthwatering-tips-on-can-achieve-mega-blogging-success/"
		>this self-admonishing article</a
	>; which is a canidate for {{ 'web decay' | twoWay }}. The article discourages
	<em>people without a thing</em>
	from blogging.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>I don't have a thing</strong>. I have no delusions for this blog.
	However; one mouthwatering tip talks about blogging as a skill that has to be
	improved over time. Paul Grahmam's formula of success importance + novelty +
	correctness + strength http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html, and a similar
	process to Sivers https://sive.rs/7
